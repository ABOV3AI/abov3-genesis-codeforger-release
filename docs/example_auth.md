# Sample Authentication

This is an example of using the `abov3 auth login` command to authenticate to the Anthropic AI provider and get the authentication key.

The command pops up a text console where you select the desired provider.

CodeForger provides a link to request the key necessary from the provider.  (The browser may go there automatically if the shell recognizes the url).

Copy/paste the URL into the browser that's authenticated to Anthropic.  After authorizing, you'll recieve the key and paste it into CodeForger.
